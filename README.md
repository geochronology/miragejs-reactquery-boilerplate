# React Query & MirageJS Boilerplate

This repo contains starter code for building a project with MirageJS and react-query.

## Sources

I built the app by combining the code from two projects, both of which I recommend for others starting out with MirageJS:

* [MirageJS React Quick Start](https://miragejs.com/quickstarts/react/develop-a-component/) from the official docs
* [Mocking and Using CRUD APIs with MirageJS and React-Query](https://www.swyx.io/react-query-miragejs-crud/) by [@swyx](https://github.com/sw-yx/)

What I combined:
* The first two sections from the Quick Start: [Develop a component](https://miragejs.com/quickstarts/react/develop-a-component/) and [Develop an app](https://miragejs.com/quickstarts/react/develop-an-app/)
* The ## React Query and some of the ## Mocking Crud sections from @swyx's CRUD project
